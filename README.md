<h1 align="center">notice for those who have i5</h1>
For those with i5 processor you should replace the config.plist in the i5config folder after you have finished the installation, do not try to install with the i5 config.plist because you will get stuck in the configuration start to create a user.
 

the rest you can discover on your own. and we hope you can share your solution with us so that we can all benefit!

You must generate your own serial number with GenSMBIOS! https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS if you don't know how google is your friend ;)
