# Surface Pro 4 i7 i5 Hackintosh base on Opencore 0.8.7 Works with Big Sur, Monterey and Ventura 13.3.1


First of all I want to start by thanking dortania.github.io @Xiashangning @acidanthera @balopez83 @chris1111 the great reddit community, and the massive Hackintosh community.

I have spent several days and hours trying to get it to work and fix bugs, but at the moment I don't have much time anymore, because of work and school

**everyone who is willing to help fix bugs is welcome!**


I have not yet been able to verify everything that is working or what is not working.








**What works?**


+ Graphics Acceleration
+ Battery
+ TypeCover Trackpad: w/gestures
+ TypeCover Hotplug
+ TouchScreen you need to manually install IPTSDaemon https://github.com/Xiashangning/IPTSDaemon
+ Wifi and Bluetooth only with dongle and https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Big-Sur-Adapter
+ and many more things are working very well the performance is very good.


**what is not working?**

+ native Wi-Fi
+ native Bluetooth
+ Volume Up
+ Volume Down
+ Power Button (Sleep/Wake)

I have updated to the latest version of opencore but I have had a problem with the trackpad and sometimes it does not appear in the settings menu

the rest you can discover on your own. and we hope you can share your solution with us so that we can all benefit!
